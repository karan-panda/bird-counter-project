# Bird Counter App ðŸ¦œ
This project holds a special place as it was my first venture into the world of JavaScriptâœ¨.

Check out the live demo of the Bird Counter App: [https://bird-counter-project.netlify.app/](https://bird-counter-project.netlify.app/)

It is a simple JavaScript website for counting birds. Keep track of the number of birds you've counted and save your entries for future reference.

## Features

- Increment and decrement buttons to adjust the bird count.
- Reset button to set the bird count back to zero.
- Save button to store the current count and calculate aggregate entries.
- Display of saved entries and aggregate count.
